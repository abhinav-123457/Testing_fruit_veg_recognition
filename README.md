## Overview
This project is focused on identifying different types of fruits and vegetables using deep learning techniques. The model utilizes image classification to differentiate various categories of produce. The code for testing the trained model is provided in the file `testing_fruit_veg_recognition.py`.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing is obtained from [source of the dataset] (insert dataset source). It contains multiple labeled images for each class (e.g., apples, bananas, carrots, etc.).

The dataset is preprocessed using image augmentation techniques to improve the generalization of the model.

## Installation
